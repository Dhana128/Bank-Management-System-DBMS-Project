# Bank-Management-System-DBMS-Project
The bank is the place where customers feel a sense of safety for their property. In the bank, customers deposit and withdraw their money. Transaction of money also is a part where a customer takes shelter from the bank. Now to keep the belief and trust of customers, there is a positive need for management of the bank, which can handle all this with comfort and ease. My model is storing data in tables: login table, signup, signup2, signup3, bank table using MySQL, and keeps track of all the transactions done by the user. A trigger can be defined to increase the balance by the amount deposited and reduce it by the amount debited. The user can deposit money, withdraw money, use the fast cash option, change the pin, print his mini statement, and also check his account balance.
